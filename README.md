# SaveNLoad
A Python script to load WC3 save files made with Guhun's Save/Load system


How does it work?
The program's main loop periodically checks your Wacraft III directory to find a load.txt file that has been created using the in-game -request command.

## Features

 - **Autoupdates**
 No need to check for updates, the program will automatically check for new updates on GitHub and update itself. You can disable this in the settings text files.

- **Read save files from GitHub**
If you supply a GitHub repository, and it is structured like a SaveNLoad saves folder, then you will be able to load files from that repository.

- **Interaction with WC3**
There is no need to alt-tab to load your saves! Just leave SaveNLoad.exe running in the backround and send request commands from the game.
